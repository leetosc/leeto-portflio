The current version of the VEYM.net website launched in October 2022. It is built with Next.js and ChakraUI and hosted on Vercel. The backend CMS is [Directus](https://directus.io/). It is easily extensible for the developers and the content editing UI is user-friendly for the content editors.

## History

The previous version of the VEYM.net website was built in 2018 using Gatsby, with a Wordpress backend. This replaced a much older Wordpress site with many usability issues.

Due to limitations imposed by the original architecture, over the years it became increasingly hard to maintain and most content changes had to be done manually in the codebase. All changes had to go through the deveopers (me).


### New Site Requirements

We decided to build a new site from scratch with the following requirements:
- Modern tech stack and architecture
- Easy for non-technical users to edit content
- Easy for developers to extend and maintain

## Development
